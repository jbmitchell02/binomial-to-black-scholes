# The Relationship Between the Multi-Period Binomial Model and the Black-Scholes Model
Author: Mitch Mitchell (jbm8efn)
*Note: The goal of this project was to use the equivalencies between the multi-period binomial model and Black-Scholes model to build a deeper understanding of both techniques, as well as geometric brownian motion in general. That's why I chose to only use functions provided by python itself and the math library.*
